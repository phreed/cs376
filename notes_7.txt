Discrete Event Systems
asynchronous model of time
event driven systems
SimEvents
example ns-2 and ns-3

conflict
indeterminate
enabled
maximal-non-conflicting sets


autonomously = insteran
external events


Include a description of the event generator mechanism.


----------
Internal transition function

if no external event occurs, the systems will state in state s for ta(s)

ta(s) is a real number in [0 inf]

when e = ta(s) expires
the systems outpus lambda(s)
the syatem transitions to s' = delta_int(s)


if ta(s) = 0 then
no external event may intervene
s is a transitory state

if ta(s) = inf
the system will stay in s forever (no lambda(s) can occur)
s is a passive state

-------------
External transition function

If an external event occurs while the system is in s but before the expiration time
(id while the system is in (s,e) whith 0 <= e <= ta(s)) the systems changes to s' = delta_ext(s,e,x)

(s,e) is called the total state because time modifies the state .
