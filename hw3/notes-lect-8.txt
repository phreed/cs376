In the DEVS model the delta functions must be defined for any possible input in any possible state.

In the storage model
  delta_ext(["passive",sigma,store], e, x) => ("passive", sigma-e, x) can be ("passive", inf, x)
In the generator the phase is uniary and therefore unnecessary


Some errors in the processor model
delta_ext( [phase sigma job] e x) =>
    ["busy" processing-time x] {if phase is "idle" }
    [phase sigma-e job]

delta_int( [phase sigma job] ) => ["idle" inf empty]

lambda ("busy" sigma job) => job
ta([phase sigma job] ) = sigma
